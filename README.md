# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Image-Denoising-via-Residual-Recovery
This is a simple implementation of DRL (PPO is used) for image denoising via residual recovery. \
Although this project is for a specific task, this framework is designed ASAP (as simple as possible) to be applied for different tasks trained in "Batch Environment" (Batch * Channel * Height * Width) by slightly modifing the corresponding network and envrionment.
